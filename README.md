# HeroSurvivors

A small Vampire Survivors–style prototype built with TypeScript, Vite, and PixiJS.

## Commands
- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run dev` – start the dev server
- `npm run build` – type-check and create a production build

## Gameplay
- Control a party of three heroes; the active hero attacks harder, followers attack in the background.
- Press **Space** or **Shift** to swap to the next hero and trigger the swap skill of their powerset.
- Enemies chase the party and drop XP pickups when defeated.
- Gather XP to level up; choose one of three upgrades with keys **1/2/3** when the level-up overlay appears.
- The main menu lets you choose the starter powerset before launching a run.
